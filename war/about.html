Ugolki is a board game originating from Russia. It is a sort of simplified version of Chinese checkers. <br>
	The beauty of this game that it has very simple rules but allows enough depth for strategical challenge.
	 It's also easy going and usually takes only about 5-10 minutes per game.<br>
I decided to create one and put on the web - for free - so you can play it versus computer player or versus human player that is sharing your computer. There's also an <a href='#' onclick="window.open('http://wave.google.com/about.html')">Google Wave</a> version of Ugolki - it  allows human vs. human mode on remote computers based on the Wave platform. Look for it in the Wave Extensions Gallery. Or "wave" me, and I will link you to the Wave installer of Ugolki.
